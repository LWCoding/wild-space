CAT:

Gnarp is from the planet Linnaeus, known for its shattering earthquakes that can break bones just from the vibrations. Because of this, residents of Linnaeus live in houses elevated off the ground on tall climbing posts. Ever since he lost his sibling to a quake accident at an early age, they have been dedicated to a job in safety, innovating to create more preventive measures to keep the planet safe. Some examples include early-warning seismic sensors and more resistant building foundations.

Throughout their experience with safety, however, he has faced many problems with the bureaucratic process and getting things into law. Being extremely frustrated at the long processes, and seeing life after life taken from natural disasters, they have been exploring the cosmos to get some insight into what causes these quakes, and what measures can be taken to save their planet.

DOG:

Purble is from the planet Barklon, a planet under authoritative regime (think very territorial dogs) that heavily restrict others' freedoms. Purble's parents worked at a fabric store, and were not confrontational in the slightest, teaching Purble to keep their head down at all times. They never understood why things had to be the way they were. 

One day, Purble noticed a group of young dogs getting abused by a city official, and feeling angry about the state of the world, lashed out against the official. Afterwards, he was threatened by the city for his good deed, but he was told to watch out for himself. To preserve the safety of his family, and angered at the regime, Purble decided to leave for the safety of their parents back home. Since that day, Purble left their planet, wandering space to carve their own story and figure out what life really means to them.

Due to an unpredictable accident, their partner passed away suddenly, leading Alfie to sink themself into their work and become very self-deprecating. 

To keep themself from thinking about their partner, they sink themself into their research. They work virtually every living moment they have, trying to prove their worth through hard work, looking up to the stars.

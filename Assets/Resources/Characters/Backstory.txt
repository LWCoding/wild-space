As a young joey, [Opossum] was abandoned by their parents at an early age. Most joeys don't survive on their own, but miraculously, [Opossum] developed street smarts, living to chase highs and go out for nights of partying and isolation -- but none of this ever scratches the itch. 

One night, however, they joined a gang, hoping to find belonging. But during this, they were peer pressured into doing the unthinkable: causing a death on the streets, another young joey, which shook them to their core.

You finish sending the report to HQ. You followed your orders and reported everything as you saw it.
<<if $posSelfPerception > $negSelfPerception>>
    You did your duty and upheld the integrity of your role. But you can't help but feel a bit conflicted about the report.
<<else>>
    You feel a bit uneasy, but you rationalize that honesty is the best policy.

Not soon after, you receive a reply from HQ.

You can't help but feel a bit guilty, but you did your best to report the facts.
And here it is, laid bare in front of you: the response from HQ.

<<if $daysPassed == 3>>
HQ sent a team to investigate the aliens you reported. They also fixed an issue with your spaceship's oxygen that you hadn't noticed before.
<<endif>>
<<if $desperate == false>>
    Days pass. And afterwards, you never hear from the aliens again.
    You presume that Earth dealt with them. You hope that, if they were found, they were treated well, but you can't shake the feeling that this isn't exactly the case.
    You live your life out on your ship, never quite feeling at peace with what happened. You never talk to anyone again.
    You're not even sure if the aliens were real to begin with.

<<else>>
    In the span of a few hours, a rapidly-moving rescue vehicle arrives at your location.
    They commandeer your ship to study the incoming signals. Meanwhile, you're shipped back to Earth, and eventually, are tasked with piloting a different space vessel.
    You never hear from the aliens again.

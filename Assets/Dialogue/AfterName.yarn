Narrator: {$playerName}... {$playerName}... that sounds right to you.
<<speed 1>>
Narrator: You open your eyes, and realize that you are no longer suspended in mid-air.
Narrator: You're lying down. On a hard surface. Your head feels heavy, and your body aches all over.
Narrator: You slowly sit up, and take in your surroundings.
<<endonce>>
Narrator: You're at home. In your metal spaceship.
    -> Hello? Is anyone there?
        Narrator: A voice, soft and distant, responds to your call. You recognize it a few seconds later as your own. Every sound you make echoes off the walls.
        <<jump AfterName>>
    -> Where... am I?
        Narrator: An echo from your voice bounces off the walls. Other than yourself, nobody responds to your question.

Narrator: This is the life that you've committed yourself to, ever since taking the job to pilot this small exploration vessel.
Narrator: Just to get a chance away from Earth, away from the people who never cared about you.
Narrator: Nothing of interest seems to be happening. You take a seat and ponder the cold, empty room around you.
    -> (do some push-ups)
        Narrator: You drop down and do a few push-ups to keep your strength up.
    -> (contemplate the meaning of life)
        Narrator: You ponder the vastness of existence and your place within it.
    -> (think of something happy)
        Narrator: You recall a fond memory that brings a smile to your face. It's a small comfort in the loneliness of space.
    -> (no use sitting around. stand back up!)
Narrator: You decide to get back to doing something. Anything is better than sitting around.

Narrator: Suddenly, the monitor jumps to life. A dark figure appears on the screen, accompanied with a garbled, static-filled voice.

Narrator: You notice a set of dials on the monitor. It seems like you need to adjust the frequency to let the signal through.

Narrator: Suddenly, the monitor in front of you jumps to life.

???: Meow! Hello!
    -> ...What?
    -> Aww, you're so cute!
        <<positive_indicator Cat>>
    -> (scream)
        <<stop_voice_blip Cat>>
        Narrator: You scream deafeningly loudly. The creature on the monitor jumps back in surprise.
        <<show_character Cat Neutral right>>
        <<start_voice_blip Cat>>
        ???: That... surely is a strange introduction, otherbeing.
<<start_voice_blip Cat>>
<<show_character Cat Thinking right>>
???: Well, you seem to be in a bit of a pickle. What're you doing in space all by yourself?
    -> What the fuck?
        <<show_character Cat Neutral right>>
        ???: ...
    -> Who... are you?
<<show_character Cat Happy right>>
Cat: Oh! I'm so sorry, I should introduce myself. My name is 猫喵猫喵, but you can just call me Cat. 
Cat: I'm what you'd probably call an "alien lifeform". Meowdy!
    -> An alien lifeform?
        <<show_character Cat Thinking right>>
        Cat: Just another way to say that I'm not... from your planet of origin.
    -> 猫喵猫喵? What does that mean?
        <<show_character Cat Thinking right>>
        Cat: It's... hard to explain. It's probably not something I can explain to you.
        <<show_character Cat Happy right>>
        Cat: Just call me Cat, it's easier that way.
    -> Meowdy?
        Cat: Meowdy.
Cat: But anyways, what's your name?
    -> My name's {$playerName}.
        Cat: {$playerName}? What a nice name!
    -> (stay silent)
        Cat: Oh, you don't have a name? That's okay, I guess.
<<declare $catKnowsAboutOtherFigure = false>>

<<show_character DogObscure Neutral left>>
Narrator: Just as Cat finishes their sentence, another silhouette appears on the monitor.
    -> Who is that?
        <<show_character Cat Neutral right>>
        <<start_voice_blip Cat>>
        <<set $catKnowsAboutOtherFigure = true>>
        Cat: Hm? Do you see someone else?
        Cat: I wouldn't worry about it.
            -> But what if they have something to say?
                Cat: Don't.
                Cat: It's probably not important.
                    -> (ignore the newcomer)
